### Primary Typefaces

#### Latin Alphabets: Source Sans Pro

There are a number of qualities that make Source Sans Pro a good fit for Liferay:

- Support for over 21 languages (including [Chinese, Japanese, and Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Han_Sans)) &mdash; critical for helping us stay consistent in [our offices all over the world](https://www.liferay.com/locations).
- Typeface for user interfaces &mdash; easy for people to read and use.
- [Open source](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro).
- Wide wariety of weights &mdash; helps us speak in the right way at the right place and context.

#### Chinese, Japanese, Korean: Source Han Sans

The Source Family includes a font with CJK characters, this helps us maintain consistency in even more languages.

### Longform Text: Source Serif Pro

In order to promote legibility and a comfortable reading experience, the serif version of our primary typeface adds nice weight, contrast, and a touch of class. Source Serif Pro should be used for lengthy copy in documents, blog posts, articles, brochures, etc. In combination with Source Sans Pro for headlines, this typographic style will display our message in reader-friendly format.

### Monospace: Source Code Pro

If you're feeling really passionate about brand continuity in your code editor, you can use Source Code Pro. It's also the preferred typeface for code snippets in documents and sites.
